This project was done during my Summer 2022 Intership as a practice project prior to research into the predictors of customer churn.
These findings were used in the data selection process of relevant predictors during the project with our undisclosed clients.
Furthermore, the project used supervised learning machine learning models to find which algorithm could potentially be used and generate the best accuracy metrics.
Due to signing an NDA, the client's name and actual project code and results cannot be shared or disclosed in any shape or form.
However, the findings of this simple practice project was used as a basis for the actual project that utilized a large relational database for modelling.
